I just visited github to check [my profile](http://github.com/kamranahmedse) and look what I found, don't know about others, but github had took me back in time to **January 4, 2014** in the graph that shows. If *I am not wrong*, what should have come after December 31st, 2014 is January 1st, 2015 but according to github it's January 4th, 2014 :P
