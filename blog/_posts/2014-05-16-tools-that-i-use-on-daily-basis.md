Since the time, I first started in web development I have tried several tools but the tools that I am going to state are the ones that have obsessed me:

#Sublime Text
Among the code editors, I have tried Dreamweaver, Notepad++, Zend Studio. But sublime was the one that I fell in love with. And the reasons are countless. To name a few; it’s light weight, beautiful, has a package manager and a wonderful community, it’s extensible and allows me write my own snippets, it’s fast, it has numerous shortcuts for almost every thing be it file switching, project switching, preference search, switching syntax plus alot more and I barely even touch mouse when working on sublime text, it supports multiple cursors, supports fuzzy search on files and preferences, supports regular expression search and replace. There are a lot more but I think the stated ones are enough to compell any one like me to switch to it.

#HeidiSQL
I have tried MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin and SQL Yog among the numerous MySQL GUI Tools out there. But HeidiSQL is the one that I have finally chosed. Again the reasons are; it’s speedy, has intellisense, shows the MySQL documentation on anything even when I am offline, maintains a history of queries executed, has a query profiler etc.

#Balsamiq Mockups
Not on daily basis, I would say, but I use Balsamiq for drawing mockups and wireframes whenever I need to. I have tried Pencil as well but sooner, I was back to balsamiq and the reason was Balsamiq has a wonderful UX.

#Other Tools
Apart from the above said tools, the others that I use are Todoist for tracking my tasks, WAMP, PHP Codelock for code encryption, Filezilla for FTP Access, Google Chrome as a default browser with it’s remarkable developer tools, Dropbox for file sharing, git for version control and Ubuntu 14.04 as my OS.
