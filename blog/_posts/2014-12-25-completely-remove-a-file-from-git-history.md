While working with any version control system e.g. `git` it is quite possible that you or anyone in the team that you are working with accidentally commits an unnecessary large sized file and nobody notices until too long when there are **hundreds** of commits have been made and deleting that large-sized file from the latest commit alone wouldn't matter much and it must be removed completely from the commits history. 

The post at [http://www.ducea.com/2012/02/07/howto-completely-remove-a-file-from-git-history/](http://www.ducea.com/2012/02/07/howto-completely-remove-a-file-from-git-history/) completely explains the process.
