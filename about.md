A **Full Stack Web Developer** having hands on experience in a variety of web technologies.

I am an experienced web developer who likes to work on all parts of the web stack. Web development is not only my profession but also a hobby for me. I believe in writing clean, maintainable and scalable code that follows the standards and best practices. I am motivated by meeting set targets within deadlines, as it gives me a sense of accomplishment and it's something that I can look back on and say "I achieved that". I create things for the web with longevity in mind, am a fast learner who tries to make each of his project a learning experience.

In my free time, I can be found working upon opensource [projects on GitHub](http://github.com/kamranahmedse) and writing through my blog [kamranahmed.info](http://kamranahmed.info).

I'm currently located in Lahore, Pakistan and have been working for [Strategic Systems International](http://ssidecisions.com). I'm available for interesting contract work as well as job opportunities. Also please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any full time job opportunities that require relocation, as I am ready to relocate if the job opportunity seems appealing.
