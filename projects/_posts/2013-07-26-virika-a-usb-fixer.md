title: Virika - A USB Fixer
---

Virika was a semester project* that I developed back in university. At that time there was this virus, that had infected every PC in the college labs. What this virus used to do was, whenever any one attached their USB to the PC, it turned all the data in that USB to shortcuts leaving the man thinking that their data had gone (I personally lost my important data by formatting the USB, thinking that the data had gone, when I first came across this virus).

So I developed this application under the slogan, no more panic attacks. All that user had to do, whenever they got attacked by this virus,  was install my app and then:

* Attach their USB to PC
* Chose the USB from the list of devices attached
* Click the Fix Button
* Thatâ€™s it, there data is back and shortcuts are removed!

>I had in my mind to develop some innovative web app, but it was specifically stated that it had to be a desktop application. So I developed this desktop application and associated website.

##Promotional Website
After the product was built, I thought to release it to the general public with a little bit of advertisement. So I designed and developed this associated website, having a detail of how to use it etc. The website is responsive and was developed using Twitter Bootstrap.
