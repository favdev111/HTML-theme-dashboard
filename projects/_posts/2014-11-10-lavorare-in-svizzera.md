Itâ€™s a portal for the companies as well as people looking for job while residing in Switzerland or Italy. I was the part of team of two members developing it. My contributions were :

* Added several KPIs to the admin dashboard
* Different types of emails to the administrator such as daily statistics etc.
* User management module in the admin dashboard
* Different types of emails to the candidate e.g. Account inactivity email, Account verification email etc
* Added pattern recognition test in the assessment section.
* Test results (percentile, percentage, ranking and other stuff) to the user
* User Management module inside the admin panel
* Added different checks on the candidate actions
* Interface changes

Also, I have been providing ongoing maintenance.
