While I was the member of MSP GCUF team, I was assigned the responsibility to develop the Microsoft Student Partner GCUF website. It was supposed to be a CMS so I thought to develop it in wordpress and I developed this wordpress theme for it. The features were:

* Completely Dynamic
* Website was responsive
* Supported a Blog, News, Project (Custom post type) and pages.
* Had custom built widgets
