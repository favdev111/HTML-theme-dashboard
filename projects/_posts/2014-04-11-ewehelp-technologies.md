title: eWeHelp Technologies

It was a static website that I developed as a freelancer for eWeHelp Technologies. Their existing website needed a redesign and they hired me to do so. From inception up till release, I had to collaborate with them, mould the website as per their requirements and take the project to a succesful completion.
