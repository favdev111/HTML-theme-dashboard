Ease of maintenance, faster development plus having a good command over wordpress were the reasons that compelled me to chose wordpress for my portfolio. Although, there are wild number of portfolio themes out there, I decided to go with my own theme.

I wanted my portfolio to be unique plus as a means to show my skills in wordpress, so I went ahead and developed this wordpress theme (that you are currently paying me a visit at). The features include:

* Custom post types ( Projects, Services )
* Custom taxonomies ( Field, Tool )
* Custom metaboxes in each post type (excerpt, project link, completion date)
* Custom widgets

##Further Detail

* Skills used were PHP, HTML/CSS, Wordpress Theme Development
