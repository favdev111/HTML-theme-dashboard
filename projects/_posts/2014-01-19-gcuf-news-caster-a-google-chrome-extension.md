It was a weekend project that I developed. It was a Google Chrome extension, that uses the News Feed (XML feed) from the website of GC University Faisalabad, parses it using Javascript and shows the news in the user’s browser.

The motivation behind was, I was having a hard time staying up to date with the Latest News and Updates from the GC University Faisalabad’s website.

Sometimes, I forgot to check the website and miss any important news and when I did visit, it was really frustrating to find out that there was nothing new there. It clicked my mind, that if I am facing this issue, the others might have been facing this as well, thus I determined to develop an extension that’d show the news and updates in user’s browser right away. Google Chrome being one of the most widely used browsers out there, I decided to develop an extension for Google chrome.

I launched the extension at Google Chrome Webstore. The number of users were more than I expected ~200 in first week. But later on, after 5-6 months, the number of users dropped as was expected and the reasons are given ahead.

There were several reasons for the fall in the use of the extension, some of them are listed below:

* There was no proper advertisement.
* I was busy with my FYP and after that my graudation was completed and I didn't have the chance to run a proper campaign
* User has to reinstall the extension, in case the browser is un-installed and the re-installed. And I guess that didn’t happen (due to lack of advertisement and all that). It should not have been the case for the users having Gmail account and synched browser but I get that not all have Gmail accounts and if they have, most of the users don’t event know about synching and all that and thus once removed, extension never got the chance to be re installed by the user.

Despite that, the extension served it's purpose i.e. I wanted to get a taste of developing Google Chrome Extension and I did learn about Chrome Extension Development API.
