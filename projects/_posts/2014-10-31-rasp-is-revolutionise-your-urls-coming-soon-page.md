title: RasP.is – Revolutionise your URLs

I was required to develop a responsive holding page for the URL shortener that I was hired to develop. The holding page has been hosted at [RasP.is](http://rasp.is). It’d soon be taken off of the given URL and it’d be replaced by the original product. In case it isn’t there, below is the snapshot of the page:
