comments: true
---

I solely developed this web based ERP System while working as a Sr. Web Developer at [Digitalsofts](http://digitalsofts.com). It was a Javascript heavy application developed in PHP and had about ~165+ usecases. The main modules of the application included:

* Accounts Management
* Production
* Inventory Management
* Users and Companies Management ( Priviliges and profiles management etc )

Apart from the trivial ERP features, some additional features were

* HTML Invoices and Report Prints
* PDF Invoices ( Single Copies and Double Copies)
* Time Tracking of the Users as they are logged in
* Users action logs
* Database Backups
* Stock Notifications
* Timeline of the tasks as they are performed.
* Company feed
* Vouchers Revision Histories (Updation history/record)
* Graphs and other visualization factors to assess different KPIs

In web development projects, this system that I developed for them was the main source of revenue and different revisions of it were delivered to 8 different national and multinational organizations including the following:

* **Afaq Traders** ( Multiple Companies Support – 1 in Dubai and 3 in Faisalabad)
Of course the system was modified as to support their domain. For example the newly added vouchers were Assembling/Deassembling Voucher, Attach Specification Items, Add Specification Items etc. Also there were new reports were introduced plus the existing ones were modified as to support their domain.

* **Oxon : International General Trading LLC** ( Multiple Companies Support – 1 in UAE and 1 in Faisalabad )
Modifications included were, the change in the prints and reports prints, also add account vouchers were changed (i.e. few new fields were added) as to support their domain.

* **Pakistan Mobile Network** (Single Company Support)
It was delivered to Mobilink Franchise located in Chakwal. I was to change the application as to support their monetary transactions, as their transactions needed high precision.

* **Metal Art Exporters** ( Multiple Companies Support )
The application was delivered as is with the slight modifications in the Invoice Prints.

* **Zarai Zameendara Faisalabad (Single Company Support)**
The sale, sale return, purchase and purchase return vouchers were modified as to implement FIFO ( i.e. first in first out; the item that was bought or produced first is to be sold first etc )

* **Kashmir CO (Single Company Support)**
They have a showroom and mainly deal in vehicles. So the system was modified as to support their domain.

* **Ahmad Electronics (Single Company Support)**
A new voucher was introduced, assembly voucher (To attach multiple items with a single item). Also the sale and purchase vouchers were modified.

* **Laptop City (Single Company Support)**
Several changes were made as to support their domain. The major changes were, an attach specification voucher was integrated which allowed them to attach multiple specifications to an item (say a laptop or a desktop). Sale, sale return, purchase, purchase return and quotation vouchers were modified accordingly.
